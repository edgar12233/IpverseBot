## Referral Program

The referral program incentivizes users to invite others to the bot. When a new user joins using your referral link, both you and the new user receive coins. To refer a user, simply send them your unique referral link generated by the bot.

To improve performance, IpverseBot uses smart caching. This means that frequently requested data is stored temporarily, reducing the need for repeated calls to external APIs. This not only speeds up response times but also helps manage API rate limits effectively.
